His point of departure was the tradicional, and in his lifetime still customary, definition of mathematics as a science of magnitude(*Grössenlehre*).
But, like the Riemann and other authors (and as usual, preceding all of them), Gauss presented a novel conception of magnitude, turng them into more abstract objects.
Thereby he came to conceive of mathematics as a theory of *relational structures*...
provided that we understand the term "structure" in a primitive, intensional sense, and refrain from assigning to it the usual extensional interpretation of set theory.

Gauss thought that the subject matter of mathematics was not certain particular objects, but rather relations between objects, and interrelation among those relations.
In his opinion, mathematics is "in the most general sense, the science of relations"; or, as he put it in the 1831 *Selbstanzeige*:

>the mathematician abstracts entirely from the quality of the objects and the content of their relations; he just occupies himself with counting and comparing their relations to each other.

In 1825, he exemplified this with the lattice of points corresponding to the Gaussian integers in the complex plane.
Those points are objects, but it is the *transitions*(*Übergänge*) from one to another which represent relations, and thus the magnitudes studied by mathematician.
The conception of mathematics as a science of relational structures form the keystone of Gauss's defense of the complex numbers.

Full acceptance of the complex numbers had been a key motice in his work from the late 1790s.
His first attempt at a proof of the "Fundamental Theorem of Algebra," contained in his 1799 dissertation, emerged from the consideration of polynomials as complex functions; but knowing that the complex numbers were still regarded with mistrust by almost all mathematicans, Gauss omitted carefully from the text of his disssertation any reference to his motivating, heuristic ideas.
For the time being, he would only express his actual thoughts in letters to close friends; in the above-mentioned letter of 1811 to Bessell, Gauss wrote:

>To somebody who wishes to introduce a new function in analysis, I would ask above all... whether he accepts my basic principle, that within the realm of magnitudes one must regard the imaginary \\(a+b\sqrt{-1}=a+bi\\) as enjoying the same right as the real [magnitudes]. ... Here it is not a question of practical utility---I take analysis to be an autonomous science, which by relegating those fictitious magnitudes would lose enormously in beauty and roundedness, and at every instant would be forced to add quite cumbersome restictions to truth that otherwise would be generally valid.

It is noteworthy that he went so far as to call this principle of "equal right" for real and imagenary magnitudes his *Grundsatz*, his fundamental principle in analysis.

At last, in 1831, and motivated by number theory---namely, by the need to expand the field of number theory to the Gaussian integers \\(a+bi\\)(with \\(a\\), \\(b\\) ratioanl integers), and even to other domains of algebraic integers---Gauss presented the well-known geometrical interpretation of complex numbers as points in the Gaussian plane.
This, however, was only an *intuitive* illustrationm to which he added a more abstract philosophical argument for their full acceptability as mathematical objects.

...

Gauss claimed that the mathematical study of the complex(resp., the negative) numbers is justified, as soon as there exist physical situations that give occasion to their employment. That is to say it suffices to show that some physical situations present us with relational sructrures that can only be represented by means of the complex(resp., the negative) numbers.
For this to be the case, Gauss claims, one cannot be dealing with simple substances, but rather must be handling relations between substances or objects.
When the relations can be inverted, the need for negative numbers emerges.
When the objects and their relations cannot be ordered into a single series, but give rise to a "series of series" or, as Gauss also put it, a "manifold of two dimensions," one must introduce a "lateral unit" \\(i\\), and with it the complex numbers.
When the objects and their relations give rise to a "manifold of two dimensions", one must introduce complex numbers.
In this sense, they are no less real or justifiable that the rational or the "real" numbers.
