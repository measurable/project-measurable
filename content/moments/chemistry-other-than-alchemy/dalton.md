Dalton proposed that a sample of an element consists of many identical atoms of constant weight, that the atoms of different elements are of different weight, that these atoms remain unchanged through chemical reactions, and that a chemical compound is composed of many identical molecules, each of which is composed of atoms of its constituent elements. This simple hypothesis immediately explained the known laws of chemical combination and then swept through chemistry during the first half of the 19th century; by 1860, stable atomic weights had been measured and confirmed and “the atom [came] into general accep- tance as the fundamental unit of chemistry” (Ihde, 1964, p. 257). Beginning in mid-century, atomic theory spread into physics with the kinetic theory of Maxwell and Boltzmann. By the end of the 1800s, the atomic theory was a well-developed scientific hypothesis with considerable empirical support.
