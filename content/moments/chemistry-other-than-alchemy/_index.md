motivation: "It is often surprising to those of us with little background in the history of science that the discipline we now know as chemistry was such a relative latecomer... 라부아지에와 돌턴 이전의 화학은 그냥 연금술이었다... 보일(1627--1691)이 유일한 예외였다. 뉴턴은 그렇지 않았다."

While Galileo was studying free fall and Newton was writing the Principia, chemistry was largely alchemy;33 the beginning of ‘modern’ chemistry is typically set around 1750, linked to the work of Lavoisier,34 and a viable atomic theory of chemical combination began only with Dalton, roughly contemporary with Fourier.
