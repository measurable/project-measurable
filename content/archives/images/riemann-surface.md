### Riemann surface for the function \\(f(z)=\sqrt z\\)
The two horizontal axes represent the real and imaginary parts of \\(z\\), while the vertical axis represents the real part of \\(\sqrt z\\). The imaginary part of \\(\sqrt z\\) is represented by the coloration of the points. For this function, it is also the height after rotating the plot \\(180^\circ\\) around the vertical axis.

The complex plane \\(\mathbf C\\) is the most basic Riemann surface. The map \\(f(z) = z\\) (the identity map) defines a chart for \\(\mathbf C\\), and \\(\\{f\\}\\) is an atlas for \\(\mathbf C\\). The map \\(g(z) = z^\ast\\) (the conjugate map) also defines a chart on \\(\mathbf C\\) and \\(\\{g\\}\\) is an atlas for \\(\mathbf C\\). The charts \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) are not compatible, so this endows \\(\mathbf C\\) with two distinct Riemann surface structures. In fact, given a Riemann surface \\(X\\) and its atlas \\(A\\), the conjugate atlas \\(B = {f^\ast:f\in A\\}\\) is never compatible with \\(A\\), and endows \\(X\\) with a distinct, incompatible Riemann structure.

In an analogous fashion, every non-empty open subset of the complex plane can be viewed as a Riemann surface in a natural way. More generally, every non-empty open subset of a Riemann surface is a Riemann surface.

Let \\(S=\mathbb C\cup\\{\infty\\}\\) and let \\(f(z)=z\\) where \\(z\\) is in \\(S\setminus\\{\infty\\}\\) and \\(g(z)=1/z\\) where \\(z\\) is in \\(S\setminus\\{0\\}\\) and \\(1/\infty\\) is defined to be 0. Then \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) are charts, they are compatible, and \\(\\{f,g\\}\\) is an atlas for \\(S\\), making \\(S\\) into a Riemann surface. This particular surface is called the Riemann sphere because it can be interpreted as wrapping the complex plane around the sphere. Unlike the complex plane, it is compact.
