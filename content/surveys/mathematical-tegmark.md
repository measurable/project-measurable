All these theories have two components: mathematical equations and "baggage'',
words that explain how they are connected to what we humans observe and intuitively understand.
Quantum mechanics as usually presented in textbooks has both
components: some equations as well as three fundamental postulates
written out in plain English.
At each level in the hierarchy of theories, new concepts
(e.g., protons, atoms, cells, organisms, cultures) are introduced
because they are convenient, capturing the essence of what
is going on without recourse to the more fundamental theory
above it.
It is important to remember, however,
that it is we humans who introduce these concepts and the words
for them: in principle, everything could have been derived
from the fundamental theory at the top of the tree, although
such an extreme reductionist approach appears useless in practice.
Crudely speaking, the ratio of equations to baggage decreases as we move down the tree, dropping near zero for highly applied fields such as medicine and sociology.
In contrast, theories near the top are highly mathematical, and
physicists are still struggling to articulate the concepts, if any,
in terms of which we can understand them. The MUH implies that the TOE indicated by the question mark at the top is purely mathematical, with no baggage whatsoever.

...

However, could it ever be possible to give a description of the external reality involving {\it no} baggage?
If so, our description of entities in the external reality and relations between them would have to be completely abstract, forcing any words or other symbols used to denote them to be mere labels with no preconceived meanings whatsoever.

A *mathematical structure* is precisely this: *abstract entities with relations between them*.
